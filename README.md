Assignment: https://uia.instructure.com/courses/8454/assignments/32001

This application is a school assignment.
The application is a to-do list with a Firebase backend. Firebase Realtime database is used to store the lists and their elements in a json nosql database.
This app gives the user the ability to create new lists, add items to the lists, and check off the finished items using a checkbox on the item. When the user is done with an item or a list, it can be deleted using the delete button. The data is stored in Firebase realtime database, and the app updates the databse and get it's data from it.

Things to implement in the future:
- Make the progressbar functional
- Add the ability to edit lists
- Add the ability to edit items
